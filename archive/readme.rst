**Still under development**
**Starting to add XL-430 servo**

**WARNING:** As I add new servos, might change some of the class names because
I don't think they make sense now. Maybe: Protocol1 (AX) and Protocol2 (XL)

This is still a work in progress and **only** supports AX-12A and XL-320. The
library is divided up as follows:

 - pyservos
 	- **ServoSerial** - half duplex hardware serial interface
	- **Packet** - creates packets to talk to the servo
	- **utils** - misc
	- **XL320** - register/command/error definitions for Dynamixel's XL-320 servo
	- **AX12** - register/command/error definitions for Dynamixel's AX-12A servo
	- **XL430** - register/command/error definitions for Dynamixel's AX-12A servo

Setup
--------

Install
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The suggested way to install this is via the ``pip`` command as follows::

	pip install pyservos

Development
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To submit git pulls, clone the repository and set it up as follows::

	git clone https://github.com/walchko/pyservos
	cd pyservos
	pip install -e .

Usage
--------

The ``\bin`` directory has a number of useful programs to set servo position or ID number. Just
run the command with the ``--help`` flag to see how to use it.

==================== ==============================================================
Command              Description
==================== ==============================================================
``servo_ping.py``    pings one or all of the servos
``servo_reboot.py``  reboots one or all servos
``servo_reset.py``   resets one or all servos to a specified level
``set_angle.py``     sets the angle of a given servo
``set_baud_rate.py`` change the baud rate of the servos
``set_id.py``        changes the ID number for a given servo
==================== ==============================================================

Documentation
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- `AX-12A Servo <https://github.com/MomsFriendlyRobotCompany/pyservos/tree/master/docs/ax12>`_
- `XL-320 Servo <https://github.com/MomsFriendlyRobotCompany/pyservos/tree/master/docs/xl320>`_
- `XL-430 Servo <https://github.com/MomsFriendlyRobotCompany/pyservos/tree/master/docs/xl430>`_

A simple example to turn the servo and turn the LED on using a USB serial converter:

.. code-block:: python

	# Run an AX-12 servo
	from pyservos import ServoSerial, Packet, AX12

	serial = ServoSerial('/dev/tty.usbserial')  # tell it what port you want to use
	# serial = ServoSerial('dummy')  # use a dummy serial interface for testing
	serial.open()

	ax = Packet(AX12)
	pkt = ax.makeServoPacket(1, 158.6)  # move servo 1 to 158.6 degrees
	ret = serial.sendPkt(pkt)  # send packet, I don't do anything with the returned status packet

	pkt = ax.makeLEDPacket(1, AX12.LED_ON)
	ret = serial.sendPkt(pkt)

Although I have made some packet creators (like LED and Servo), you can make
your own using the basic ``makeWritePacket`` and ``makeReadPacket``.

.. code-block:: python

	# Run an XL-320 servo
	from pyservos import Packet, XL320
	from pyservos.utils import angle2int

	xl = Packet(XL320)

	# let's make our own servo packet that sends servo 3 to 220.1 degrees
	ID = 3
	reg = XL320.GOAL_POSITION
	params = angle2int(220.1)  # convert 220.1 degrees to an int between 0-1023
	pkt = xl.makeWritePacket(ID, reg, params)
